## A. Income Analysis (Waterfall Chart)
"This waterfall chart doesn't just show numbers; it visually narrates the journey of gross income to net take-home pay. You can instantly see how every deduction â€“ like taxes and insurance â€“ shapes the final amount, while also highlighting the positive boost from bonuses or other income."

## B. Expense Breakdown (Funnel Chart)
"With this funnel chart, we dissect spending patterns to reveal your financial landscape. It precisely identifies where your money goes, from essential cost centers like housing and food, down to discretionary spending, giving you clear insights for strategic budgetoptimization."

## C. Savings Ratio (Donut Chart)
"The donut chart provides an immediate and crystal-clear picture of your financial health. It strikingly illustrates the split between expenses and savings â€“ for instance, showcasing a 61% expense to 39% savings distribution â€“ empowering you to make truly informed financial planning decisions."

# Project Value Statement:
"These interactive visualizations transform raw financial data into actionable insights, enabling better personal finance decisions through clear, dashboard-ready representations of income allocation, spending habits, and savings potential."
